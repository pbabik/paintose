A simplistic HTML5 image processing application.

The project started because I became tired of using GIMP for most trivial image processing tasks like cropping, rotating and resizing.
This application uses HTML5 Canvas and HTML5 File API for client-side image processing in the browser. Right now it supports loading files from a disk, cropping, downscaling to some hardcoded dimensions, rotating, and freehand drawing with 5px red brush.
More drawing tools will come in the future.
